1. generate random email for testing
2. actual script to send email. 
The program is written in such a way that it sends bulk email but no like in gmail, you can actually provide a csv file where you have name and email of the person to whom email is to be sent and then it sends email one by one.
This helps to send same email to different persons but not at single time, rather it sends one by one specifying name and email.
